There are a total of 3 revision of the 4xMacropad. 
The rev 1 is internal testing build in which it screw up so I am not releasing it here.

Rev 2 is the one that you found on hackaday.io and Instructable, also the first few batches
you can get on Tindie.

Rev 3 is an updated version that use micro-USB for input and support 5 pins switches.
If you gonna make one for your self, this is a better options compre to the original v2
which uses the mini-USB port (only if you are good at soldering)
